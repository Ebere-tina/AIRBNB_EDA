# Airbnb Listings: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings. The goal is to uncover insights from the dataset, identify trends, and highlight potential anomalies in the listings data.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The notebook covers:

- Cleaning and preprocessing price fields (e.g., converting `$1,200` to `1200` numeric format).
- Identifying the top 10 neighborhoods by total revenue.
- Calculating the average price per room type.
- Analyzing the correlation between availability and price.
- Detecting hosts with more than 10 listings (potential business operators).
- Finding outliers, such as listings with prices greater than $1000 per night.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset used contains Airbnb listings data with attributes like price, room type, availability, host details, and neighborhood.
